## Bomb the car

### A simplistic game for workshop

This is a very simplistic game for runing a workshop on refactoring code on Ruby. The game is writen in Gosu and it have less sense to play it than chewing bubblegum.

### Enhancing the Game

If you would like to enhance the game remember to do it in the most horrible way. Don't expect this game evolves to better but for worse code so the refactoring workshop get better on time.

All contributions are pretty much welcome following the last paragraph. If you want to show how bad can you code when you try to do it really bad... be my guess.

### Initial setup

Install Ruby 1.9.3-p547

Install Gems
> bundle install

Run the game
> ruby game.rb
